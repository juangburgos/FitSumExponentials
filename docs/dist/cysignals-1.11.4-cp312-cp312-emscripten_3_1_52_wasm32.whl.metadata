Cython and interrupts
---------------------

When writing `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_ code, special care must be
taken to ensure that the code can be interrupted with ``CTRL-C``.
Since Cython optimizes for speed, Cython normally does not check for
interrupts. For example, code like the following cannot be interrupted
in Cython::

    while True:
        pass

The ``cysignals`` package provides mechanisms to handle interrupts (and other
signals and errors) in Cython code.

Requirements
------------

- Python >= 3.6
- Cython >= 0.28
- Sphinx >= 1.6 (for building the documentation)
- PARI/GP (optional; for interfacing with the PARI/GP signal handler)

* Fixed segmentation fault that could occur when ``sig_occurred()`` is
  called recursively during garbage collection. [#127]

* Improved error reporting of signals that occurred inside ``sig_on()`` as
  opposed to outside them.

* Fixed bug in the ``cysignals_example`` package. [#113]
